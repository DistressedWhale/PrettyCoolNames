# Pretty Cool Names

### A simple mod for Into the Breach, by Subset Games.
### Instead of mech names being boring stuff like "Punch Mech", the names are picked from a random list of names such as "Vanguard", "Striker" etc.

## Installation
1. Download the git repository
2. Move `PrettyCoolNames.lua` into `steamapps/common/Into The Breach/scripts`
3. Open scripts.lua with a text editor. Add the line:

```
"scripts/PrettyCoolNames.lua",
```

after

```
"scripts/pawns.lua",
```

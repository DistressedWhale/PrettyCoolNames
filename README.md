# Pretty Cool Names

##### A simple mod for Into the Breach by Subset Games.
 Instead of mech names being boring stuff like "Punch Mech", the names are picked from a random list of names such as "Vanguard", "Striker" etc.
 
 Only the first five squads are done. (Rift Walkers, Rusting Hulks, Zenith Guard, Blitzkrieg and Steel Judoka)

## Installation
1. Download the git repository
2. Move `PrettyCoolNames.lua` into `steamapps/common/Into The Breach/scripts`
3. Open scripts.lua (found in the same scripts directory) with a text editor. Add the line:

```
"scripts/PrettyCoolNames.lua",
```

after

```
"scripts/pawns.lua",
```

Make sure the commas are included.

## How to Uninstall
1. Remove the line `"scripts/PrettyCoolNames.lua",` from `scripts.lua`
2. (Optional) Delete PrettyCoolNames.lua
